# Chapter 2.4 Interpretations of the Derivative

## Problems

> [!problem] **Problem** (Problem 1)
> The cost, $C$ (in dollars), to produce $g$ gallons of a chemical can be expressed as $C = f(g)$. Using units, explain the meaning of the following statements in terms of the chemical:
>
> **(a)** $f(200) = 1300$
> **(b)** $f'(200) = 6$

*Part A*
200 gallons cost 1300 dollars.

*Part B*
The cost per gallon is 6 dollars.

> [!question] **Question** (Problem 2)
> The time for a chemical reaction, $𝑇$ (in minutes), is a function of the amount of catalyst present, $𝑎$ (in milliliters), so $𝑇 = 𝑓 (𝑎)$.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part A)
> **(a)** If $f(5)=18$, what are the units of 5? What are the units of 18? What does this statement tell us about the reaction?

5 units of catalyst implies that it would take around 18 minutes.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part B)
> **(b)** If $f'(5)=-3$, what are the units of 4? What are the units of -3? What does this statement tell us?

A unit increase of catalyst decreases the chemical reaction time by 3 minutes.

> [!question] **Question** (Problem 3)
> The temperature, $T$, in degrees Fahrenheit, of a cold yam placed in a hot oven is given by $𝑇 = 𝑓 (𝑡)$, where $t$ is the time in minutes since the yam was put in the oven.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part A)
> **(a)** What is the sign of $f'(t)$? Why?

$f'(t)$ is positive because the yam is increasing in temperature.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part B)
> **(b)** What are the units of $f'(20)$? What is the practical meaning of the statement $f'(20)=2$?

$f'(20)=2$, the yam increased by 2 Fahrenheit exactly 20 minutes.

> [!question] **Question** (Problem 4)
> The temperature, $H$, in degrees Celsius, of a cup of coffee placed on the kitchen counter is given by $𝐻 = 𝑓 (𝑡)$, where $t$ is in minutes since the coffee was put on the
> counter.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part A)
> **(a)** Is $𝑓''(𝑡)$ positive or negative? Give a reason for your answer.

$f'(t)$ is negative because coffee loses its heat.

> [!problem] **Problem** (Part B)
> **(b)** What are the units of $𝑓''(20)$? What is its practical meaning in terms of the temperature of the coffee?

$f'(20)$ is the rate the coffee loses heat at $t=20$ minutes.
