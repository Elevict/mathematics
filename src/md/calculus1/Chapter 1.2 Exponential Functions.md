# Exponential Function

## Concavity

> [!definition] **Definition** (Concavity)
> The graph of a function is **concave up** if it bends upward as we move left to right; it is
> **concave down** if it bends downward. A line is neither concave up nor concave down.

## Exponential Functions

> [!definition] **Definition** (Exponential Function)
> We say $P$ is an exponential function of $t$ with base $a$ if
>
> $$
> P = P_{0}a^{t}
> $$
>
> where $P_{0}$ is the initial quantity (when $t = 0$) and $a$ is the factor by which $P$ changes when t increases by 1.
>
> If $a > 1$, we have exponential growth; if $0 < a < 1$, we have exponential decay.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Half-Life)
> The **half-life** of an exponentially decaying quantity is the time required for the quantity to be reduced by a factor of one half.
> The **doubling time** of an exponentially increasing quantity is the time required for the quantity to double.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Exponential Growth and Decay)
> Any **exponential growth** function can be written, for some $a > 1$ and $k > 0$, in the form
>
> $$
> P = P_{0}at \ \text{ or } \ P = P_{0}e^{kt}
> $$
>
> and any **exponential decay** function can be written, for some $0 < a < 1$ and $−k < 0$, as
>
> $$
> Q = Q_{0}at \ \text{ or } \ Q = Q_{0}e^{−kt},
> $$
>
> where $P_{0}$ and $Q_{0}$ are the initial quantities.
>
> We say that $P$ and $Q$ are growing or decaying at a continuous rate of $k$. (For example, $k = 0.02$ corresponds to a continuous rate of 2%.)

## Exercises
