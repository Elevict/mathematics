# Chapter 5.1 how Do We Measure Distance Traveled

## Velocity as an Indicator of Position

> [!corollary] **Corollary** (Finding Total Distance from Velocity)
> If the velocity is positive, then the total distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve. Otherwise, you will need to take the absolute value of all areas if the velocity is negative to get the **total distance**.

In other words,
- Change in position is given by the area above axis minus area below the axis, which is called the *displacement*
- Distance traveled is given by the area above the axis plug the area below the axis.
