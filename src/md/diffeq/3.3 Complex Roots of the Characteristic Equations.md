# Complex Roots of the Characteristic Equations

We work with a second order differential equation with constant coefficients, which has the form

$$
ay'' + by' + cy = 0
$$

and we explored that we use the characteristic equation to solve. The characteristic equation above would be

$$
ar^{2} + br + c = 0
$$

where $r$ would originally be real numbers. But what if the roots where complex numbers such as

$$
r_{1} = \lambda + i \mu, \quad r_{2} = \lambda - i \mu
$$

where both $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are real. Then the corresponding solution is

$$
y(t) = C_{1}e^{\lambda t}(\cos \mu t) + C_{2}e^{\lambda t}(\sin \mu t)
$$

where $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are arbitrary constants. This comes from the fact that we can use euler's formula to convert it into trigonometric functions. To see this in action, just note that

$$
e^{\lambda t + i \mu t} = e^{\lambda t} \cos (\mu t) \text{ and } e^{\lambda t - i \mu t} = e^{\lambda t} \sin(\mu t)
$$

and plugging it in and noting that any combination of solutions gives a solution, you get the above formula.

**Problem 1**

Find the general solution to $y'' + 4y' + 7y = 0$

$$
\begin{align}
y'' + 4y' + 7y &= 0 \\
r^{2} + 4r + 7 &= 0 \\
r = \frac{-(4) - \sqrt{16 - 4(1)(7)}}{2} &= \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2} \\
r &= -2 \pm \sqrt{3}i \\
y &= C_{1}e^{-2t}\cos(\sqrt{3}t) + C_{2}e^{-2t}\sin(\sqrt{3}t)
\end{align}
$$
