> where $A$ is a real $2 \times 2$ matrix with complex eigenvalues $\lambda \pm i\mu$. Then, the general solution of the system can be expressed as a combination of real-valued functions derived from the real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalue solutions.

*Proof*
Let the matrix $A$ have eigenvalues $r_1 = \lambda + i\mu$ and $r_2 = \lambda - i\mu$. The corresponding eigenvectors are complex conjugates, $\xi^{(1)} = a + ib$ and $\xi^{(2)} = a - ib$. The solutions of the system are of the form

$$
x^{(1)}(t) = \xi^{(1)} e^{r_1 t}, \quad x^{(2)}(t) = \xi^{(2)} e^{r_2 t}.
$$

These solutions are complex conjugates of each other, so we can separate them into real and imaginary parts to obtain two real-valued solutions. By taking the real and imaginary components of $x^{(1)}(t)$ or $x^{(2)}(t)$, we obtain:

$$
u(t) = e^{\lambda t} \left(a \cos(\mu t) - b \sin(\mu t)\right),
$$

$$
v(t) = e^{\lambda t} \left(a \sin(\mu t) + b \cos(\mu t)\right).
$$

Thus, $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ form a fundamental set of real-valued solutions to the system.

$$
\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
$$

If $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ are real-valued solutions to the system $x' = Ax$, where $A$ has complex eigenvalues, then the Wronskian of $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ is given by:

$$
W(u, v)(t) = \begin{vmatrix}
e^{\lambda t} \cos(\mu t) & e^{\lambda t} \sin(\mu t) \\
-e^{\lambda t} \sin(\mu t) & e^{\lambda t} \cos(\mu t)
\end{vmatrix} = e^{2\lambda t} (\cos^2(\mu t) + \sin^2(\mu t)) = e^{2\lambda t}.
$$

Thus, the Wronskian is never zero, confirming that $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ are linearly independent.

> [!theorem] **Theorem 7.6.3: Behavior of the Origin for Complex Eigenvalues**
> Let the matrix $A$ have complex eigenvalues with a negative real part. Then the origin is a spiral point and is asymptotically stable, with all trajectories approaching the origin along spiral paths.

*Proof*
Consider the solutions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$, where the real part of the eigenvalues is negative, $\lambda < 0$. The trajectories of the solutions are spiral paths that approach the origin as $t \to \infty$, due to the decaying exponential factor $e^{\lambda t}$.

Thus, the origin is a stable spiral point, and all trajectories eventually spiral inward towards the origin.

$$
\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
$$

> [!theorem] **Theorem 7.6.4: Behavior of the Origin for Complex Eigenvalues with Positive Real Part**
> Let the matrix $A$ have complex eigenvalues with a positive real part. Then the origin is an unstable spiral point, with trajectories spiraling outward as $t \to \infty$.

*Proof*
When the real part of the eigenvalues is positive, $\lambda > 0$, the solutions again describe spiral trajectories. However, due to the growth of the exponential term $e^{\lambda t}$, the trajectories spiral outward from the origin.

Thus, the origin is an unstable spiral point.

$$
\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
$$

> [!corollary] **Corollary: Transition Between Types of Spiral Points**
> If the real part of the eigenvalues is zero, then the trajectories of the system neither approach the origin nor become unbounded. Instead, they trace closed curves around the origin, forming periodic orbits.

*Proof*
When $\lambda = 0$, the solutions are sinusoidal, leading to trajectories that form closed loops in the phase plane. These trajectories represent periodic solutions, and the origin is called a center.

$$
\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
$$

> [!example] **Example 1**
> Consider the system described by the matrix $A$ with eigenvalues $r_1 = \lambda + i\mu$ and $r_2 = \lambda - i\mu$. The phase portrait for this system will depend on the sign of $\lambda$.

- For $\lambda < 0$, the trajectories will spiral inward towards the origin, indicating an asymptotically stable spiral.
- For $\lambda > 0$, the trajectories will spiral outward from the origin, indicating an unstable spiral.
- For $\lambda = 0$, the trajectories will trace closed loops around the origin, indicating a center.

Assume a solution of the form:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\xi} e^{rt}
$$

Substitute into the system, yielding the linear algebraic equation:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} - r & 1 \\ -1 & -\frac{1}{2} - r \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \xi_1 \\ \xi_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Solve the characteristic equation:

$$
\left| \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} - r & 1 \\ -1 & -\frac{1}{2} - r \end{pmatrix} \right| = r^2 + r + 5 = 0
$$

The eigenvalues are:

$$
r_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + i, \quad r_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - i.
$$

For each eigenvalue, solve the system to find the eigenvectors:

For $r_1 = -\frac{1}{2} + i$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\xi}^{(1)} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix}.
$$

For $r_2 = -\frac{1}{2} - i$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\xi}^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix}.
$$
Thus, a fundamental set of solutions is:

$$
\mathbf{x}^{(1)}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix} e^{\left( -\frac{1}{2} + i \right) t}, \quad \mathbf{x}^{(2)}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} e^{\left( -\frac{1}{2} - i \right) t}.
$$
