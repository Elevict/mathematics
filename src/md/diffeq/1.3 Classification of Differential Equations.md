# Classification of Differential Equations

## Definition

An equation containing the derivatives of one or more unknown functions (dependent variables) with respect to one or more independent variables is said to be a **differential equation**.

## Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations

- If a differential equation (DE) contains only **ordinary derivatives** of one or more unknown functions with respect to a single independent variable, it is said to be an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**.
- An equation involving **partial derivatives** of one or more unknown functions of two or more independent variables is called a **partial differential equation (PDE)**.

## Order of a Differential Equation

The **order** of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.

## Linear and Nonlinear Differential Equations

- An $n$th-order ODE of the form

$$
F(x, y, y', \dots, y^{(n)}) = 0
$$

  is said to be **linear** if $F$ is linear in $y, y', y'', \dots, y^{(n)}$.

- An $n$th-order ODE is linear if it can be expressed as:

$$
a_{n}(x) \frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}} + a_{n-1}(x) \frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} + \dots + a_{1}(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + a_{0}(x)y = g(x)
$$

- A **nonlinear ODE** is any ODE that does not satisfy the linearity condition above.

### Examples of Classification

**Given a differential equation, classify it as ODE or PDE, determine the order, and identify the independent and dependent variables. For ODEs, also classify as linear or nonlinear:**

1. $x^{3} \frac{d^{3}y}{dx^{3}} + x \frac{dy}{dx} - 5y = e^{x}$
   - Type: ODE
   - Order: 3rd
   - Independent variable: $x$
   - Dependent variable: $y$
   - Linearity: Linear

2. $\frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial x^{2}} = \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial t^{2}} - 2\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$
   - Type: PDE
   - Order: 2nd
   - Independent variables: $x, t$
   - Dependent variable: $u$

3. $\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + \sin y = 0$
   - Type: ODE
   - Order: 2nd
   - Independent variable: $x$
   - Dependent variable: $y$
   - Linearity: Nonlinear

### Writing Differential Equations for Physical Descriptions

1. The velocity at time \(t\) of a particle moving along a straight line is proportional to the population at time \(t\):

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = kx
$$
2. The rate of change of the mass $A$ of the salt at time $t$ is proportional to the square of the mass of salt present at time $t$:
   
$$

   \frac{dA}{dt} = kA^{2}

   $$
