**Problem 1**

Determine intervals in which solutions are sure to exist.

$$
(x-1)y^{(4)} + (x+1)y'' + (\tan x)y = 0
$$

then we need to divide the first term out, and simplify to get

$$
y^{(4)} + \frac{(x+1)y''}{x-1} + \frac{(\sin x)y}{(x-1)(\cos x)} = 0
$$

which tells us that $x-1 \neq 0$ and $\cos x \neq 0$. Therefore, we know that $x \neq 1$ and $x \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Problem 2**

Determine whether the given functions are linearly dependent or linearly independent.

$$
f_{1}(t) = 2t - 3, \ f_{2}(t) = t^{2} + 1, \ f_{3}(t) = 2t^{2} - t
$$

$$
\begin{align}
W(f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}) = \begin{vmatrix}
2t-3 & t^{2}+1  & 2t^{2} - t \\
2 & 2t & 4t - 1 \\
0 & 2 & 4
\end{vmatrix}
&= -2 \begin{vmatrix}
2t - 3 & 2t^{2} - t \\
2 & 4t - 1
\end{vmatrix}
+ 4 \begin{vmatrix}
2t-3 & t^{2}+1 \\
2 & 2t
\end{vmatrix} \\
&= -2[(2t-3)(4t-1) - 2(2t^{2}-t)] + 4[(2t-3)(2t) - 2(t^{2}+1)] \\
&= -2[8t^{2} - 2t - 12t + 3 - 4t^{2} + 2t] + 4[4t^{2} - 6t - 2t^{2} - 2] \\
&= -2[4t^{2} - 12t + 3] + 4[2t^{2} - 6t - 2] \\
&= -8t^{2} + 24t - 6 + 8t^{2} - 24t - 8 \\
&= -14
\end{align}
$$

since $W \neq 0$, then the functions are linearly independent.
