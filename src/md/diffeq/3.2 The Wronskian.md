*Proof*

Let $y = c_{1}y_{1}(t) + c_{2}y_{2}(t)$ be one such solution, then

$$
\begin{align}
L[c_{1}y_{1} + c_{2}y_{2}] &= [c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}]'' + p[c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}]' + q[c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}] \\
&= c_{1}y_{1}'' + c_{2}y_{2}'' + c_{1}py_{1}'+c_{2}py_{2}' + c_{1}qy_{1} + c_{2}qy_{2} \\
&= c_{1}[y_{1}'' + py_{1}' + qy_{1}] + c_{2}[y_{2}'' + py_{2}' + qy_{2}] \\
&= c_{1}L[y_{1}] + c_{2}L[y_{2}]
\end{align}
$$

Since $L[y_{1}] = 0$ and $L[y_{2}] = 0$, it follows that $L[x_{1}y_{1} + c_{2}y_{2}] = 0$ also. Therefore, regardless of the values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ we still satisfy the differential equation since it all equals 0.

$$
\tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
$$

Now from linear algebra, we can determine whether two solutions are independent of dependent by using the **Wronskian** which is defined as

$$
W = \begin{vmatrix}
y_{1}(t_{0}) & y_{2}(t_{0}) \\
y_{1}'(t_{0}) & y_{2}'(t_{0})
\end{vmatrix} =
y_{1}(t_{0})y_{2}'(t_{0}) - y_{1}'(t_{0})y_{2}(t_{0})
$$

which when nonzero implies the two solutions $y_{1}(t_{0})$ and $y_{2}(t_{0})$ are independent.

Therefore, this would mean $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ form the general solution as they are the basis for the entire set of solutions.

**Problem 1**

Use the Wronskian to prove that the following functions are linearly independent:

$$
y_{1}(t) = e^{3t}, \ y_{2}(t) = e^{-3t}
$$

$$
W = \begin{vmatrix}
e^{3t}  & e^{-3t} \\
3e^{3t} & -3e^{-3t}
\end{vmatrix}
= -3e^{0} - 3e^{0} = 6 \neq 0
$$

therefore, the two functions are linearly independent.

**Problem 2**

Use the Wronskian to prove that the following functions are linearly independent:

$$
y_{1}(t) = e^{t}, \ y_{2}(t) = e^{2t}, \ y_{3}(t) = e^{3t}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
W = \begin{vmatrix}
e^{t} & e^{2t} & e^{3t} \\
e^{t} & 2e^{2t} & 3e^{3t} \\
e^{t} & 4e^{2t} & 9e^{3t}
\end{vmatrix} &= 18e^{6t} + 3e^{6t} + 4e^{6t} - 2e^{6t} - 12e^{6t} - 9e^{6t}= 2e^{6t} \neq 0
\end{align}
$$

therefore, the two functions are linearly independent.
