# Chapter 12.3 Contour Diagrams

## Contour Diagrams

### Definition

A contour diagram (or contour plot) is a graphical representation of a three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional plane. It displays curves called **contours** that represent lines of constant value for a function of two variables.

### Key Features

- **Contours**: Lines on the plot where the function value is constant. Each contour line connects points of equal value.
- **Levels**: Different contour lines represent different levels of the function value.
- **Intervals**: The space between contour lines indicates the rate of change of the function.

### Example

Consider a function $f(x, y)$ representing the temperature at different locations on a map. A contour plot might show:

- **Isotherms**: Curves of constant temperature. For example, an isotherm of 70°F might include all points where the temperature is exactly 70°F.
- **Elevation Contours**: Curves of constant elevation, often used in topographic maps.

### How to Read Contour Diagrams

1. **Identify Contours**: Each contour line corresponds to a specific value of the function.
2. **Interpret Intervals**: Closely spaced contours indicate a steep gradient (rapid change in value), while widely spaced contours indicate a gentle gradient.
3. **Estimate Values**: Interpolate between contour lines to estimate function values at specific points.

### Applications

- **Topographic Maps**: Represent elevation changes over a geographical area.
- **Weather Maps**: Show isotherms for temperature, isobars for pressure, etc.
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: Used to analyze terrain and other spatial data.

### Example Problem

Consider a contour plot of elevation over a region with contour lines every 100 meters. If the contour lines are spaced 200 meters apart, the gradient is mild. If they are spaced 50 meters apart, the gradient is steep.
