# 6.3 Orthogonal Projections

## The Orthogonal Decomposition Theorem

Let $W$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then each $y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be written uniquely in the form $y = \hat{y} + z$ where $\hat{y}$ is in $W$ and $z$ in $W^{\perp}$.

If $\{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ is an orthogonal basis of $W$, then

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{y\cdot u_{1}}{u_{1} \cdot  u_{1}}u_{1} + \frac{y \cdot u_{2}}{u_{2} \cdot  u_{2}}u_{2} + \dots + \frac{y\cdot u_{p}}{u_{p}\cdot u_{p}}u_{p}
$$

$\hat{y}$ is called the orthogonal projection of $y$ onto $W$, and we write:

$$
\hat{y} = proj_{w}(y) = proj_{L}(y) \quad \text{ (If $y$ is in W, then you let the projection just be y)}
$$

if $\{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ is an orthonormal basis for a subspace $W$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $proj_{w}(y) = (y \cdot u_{1})u_{1} + \dots + (y \cdot u_{p})u_{p}$

## The Best Approximation Theorem

Let $W$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and let $\hat{y}$ be the orthogonal projection of $y$ onto $W$. Then $\hat{y}$ is the closest point in $W$ to $y$, that is $\lVert y - \hat{y} \rVert < \lVert y - v \rVert$ for all $v$ in $W$ distinct from $\hat{y}$.
