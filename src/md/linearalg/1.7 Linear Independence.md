# 1.7 Linear Independence

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linearly Independent)
> If $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are $p$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{^{n}}$, $v_{1}, v_{2},  \dots, v_{p}$ are said to be **linearly independent** if the linear combination $x_{1}v_{1}+x_{2}v_{2}+\dots+x_{p}v_{p}=0$ has only the trivial solution.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linearly Dependent)
> $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are **linearly dependent** if there exists $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{p}$ not all zero such that $x_{1}v_{2}+x_{2}v_{2}+\dots+x_{p}v_{p} = 0$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Linearly Independent Matrix)
> The columns of a matrix $A$ are linearly independent if and only if the equation $Ax = 0$ has only the trivial solution.
> - A set of 2 vectors is linearly dependent if one of the vectors is a multiple of the other

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Linearly Dependent Vectors)
> $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors is a linear combination of the others.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Dependence Implies Vector in Span)
> If $u, v, w$ are 3 vectors and $u, v$ are independent, then $w$ is in $span\{ u, v \}$ if and only if $u, v, w$ are dependent.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Linear Dependence)
> If a set contains more vectors than there are entries in each vector, then the set is linearly dependent.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Zero Vector Implies Dependence)
> If a set of $p$ vectors contains the zero vector, then it's dependent
