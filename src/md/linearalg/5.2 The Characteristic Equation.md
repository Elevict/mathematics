# 5.2 The Characteristic Equation

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Invertible $n \times n$ Matrix)
> $A$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix if and only if the number 0 isn't an eigenvalue of $A$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Characteristic Equation)
> $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ if and only if $\lambda$ satisfies the characteristic equation:
>
> $$
> \det(A - \lambda I_{n}) = 0
> $$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Matrix Similarity)
> Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n \times n$ matrices. We say $A$ is similar to $B$ if there is an invertible matrix $P$ such that $B = P^{-1}AP$ (or equivalently $A = PBP^{-1}$, we also say $A$ and $B$ are similar).

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Similarity Implies Same Characteristic Equation)
> If $A$ and $B$ be two similar matrices, then they have the same characteristic equation and the same eigenvalues (with the same multiplicity).
