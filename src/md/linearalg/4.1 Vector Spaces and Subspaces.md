# 4.1 Vector Spaces and Subspaces

> [!definition] **Definition** (Vector Space)
> A vector space $V$ is a nonempty set of elements called *vectors*, endowed with a rule for addition and a rule for *scalar multiplication*. These operations satisfy the following 10 axioms:
>
> for all $u, v, w$ in $V$ and all scalars (real numbers) $c$, $d$
>
> 1. $u+v$ is in $V$
> 2. $u+v=v+u$
> 3. $(u+v)+w = u + (v+w)$
> 4. There is a neutral element in $V$ called zero 0 such that, $u + 0 = u$ for all $u$ in $V$
> 5. For each $u$ in $V$, there is a vector a unique $v$ in $V$ such that $u + v = 0$. This unique $v$ is denoted by $(-u)$
> 6. $cu$ is in $V$
> 7. $c(u+v) = cu + cv$
> 8. $(c+d)u = cu + du$
> 9. $c(du) = (cd)u$
> 10. $1u = u$

## Examples of Vector Spaces

$\mathbb{R}^{n}, M_{2 \times 2}, P_{n}$ (With standard addition and scalar multiplication)
$M_{2 \times 2}:$ set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries
$P_{n}:$ set of all polynomials of degree $\leq n$ with real coefficients

A set that is not a vector space: $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with standard addition and scalar multiplication defined by: if $u = (u_{1}, u_{2})$ with $u_{2} \neq 0$, then $cu = (cu_{1}, 0)$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Subspace)
> A subspace of a vector space $V$ is a subset $H$ of $V$ satisfying
> 1. The zero vector of $V$ is in $H$
> 2. $H$ is closed under addition: if $u, v$ in $H$, then $u + v$ is also in $H$
> 3. $H$ is closed under scalar multiplication: if $u$ in $H$, then for all scalar $c$, the vector $cu$ is also in.
>
> Remark: Parts 2 and 3 above can be summarized by:
> $H$ is closed under linear combination: if $u, v$ in $H$ and $c, d$ scalars then $cu+dv$ is also in $H$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Spans are Subspaces and Subspaces can be Written as a Span)
> If $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are in a vector space $V$, then $H = span\{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p} \}$ is a subspace of $V$.
