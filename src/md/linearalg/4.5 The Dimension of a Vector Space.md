# 4.5 The Dimension of a Vector Space

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Dependence of Basis)
> If a vector space $V$ has a basis $B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n} \}$, then any set in $V$ containing more than $n$ vectors must be linearly dependent.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Cardinality of Basis)
> If a vector space $V$ has a basis of $n$ vectors, then every basis $V$ has must contain exactly $n$ vectors.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Dimension of a Vector Space)
> If $V$ is spanned by a finite set, then $V$ is said to be finite-dimensional and the dimension of $V$, written $\text{dim}(V)$, is the number of vectors in a basis of $V$.
>
> If $V$ is not spanned by a finite set, then $V$ is said to be infinite dimensional.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Expansion of Subspaces)
> Let $H$ be a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$. Any linearly independent set in $H$ can be expanded to a basis of $H$, and $\text{dim}(H) \leq \text{dim}(V)$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (The Basis Theorem)
> Let $V$ be a $p$-dimensional vector space with $p \geq 1$. Any linearly independent set of exactly $p$ vectors in $V$ is automatically a basis of $V$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Dimension of Null and Column Spaces)
> If $A$ is an $n \times m$ matrix, the dimension of $NUL \ \ A$ is the number of free variables in the equation $Ax = 0$ and the dimension of $COL \ \ A$ is the number of pivot columns of A.
