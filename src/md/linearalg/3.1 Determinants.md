# 3.1 Determinants

> [!definition] **Definition** (Determinant)
> For $n \geq 2$, the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is given by $\det A = a_{11}\det A_{11} - a_{12}\det A_{12} + \dots + (-1)^{n+1}a_{1n}\det A_{1n}$ (expansion across the first row). Where $A_{ij}$ is the matrix obtained by removing row $i$ and column $j$ from matrix $A$. The notation is $\det A = |A|$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Cofactor)
> The $(i, j)$ *cofactor* of $A$ is the number $C_{ij}$ defined by $C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \det A_{ij}$ so

> $$
> \det A = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + \dots + a_{1n}C_{1n}

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Cofactor Expansion)
> The determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ can be computed by a cofactor expansion across any row or down any column.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Determinant of Triangular Matrix)
> If $A$ is a triangular matrix, then $\det A$ is the product of the entries on the main diagonal.
