# 1.5 Solution Sets of Linear Systems

> [!definition] **Definition** (Homogenous Linear System)
> A *homogenous linear system* is a system of the form $Ax = 0$. Such a system has at least one solution $x=0$, called the *trivial solution*.

The homogenous system $Ax=0$ has a nontrivial solution if and only if it has at least one free variables.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Equation of a Plane)
> The equation $x=su+tv$, where $s, t$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and $u, v$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a parametric vector equation (equation of a plane in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$)

> [!definition] **Definition** (Equation of a Line)
> The equation $x = p + tv$, where $t$ in $\mathbb{R}$ and $p, v$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a parametric vector equation (equation of a line in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$)

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Generalized Solution Set)
> If the system $Ax = b$ is consistent for some $b$ and $p$ is a solution of $Ax = b$ then the solution set of the system $Ax=b$ is the set of all vectors of the form $w=p+v_{h}$ where $v_{h}$ is any solution of the homogenous system $Ax=0$
