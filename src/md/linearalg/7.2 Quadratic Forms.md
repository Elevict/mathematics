# 7.2 Quadratic Forms

> [!definition] **Definition** (Quadratic Form)
> A quadratic form is a function $Q$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by $Q(x) = x^{T}Ax$ where $A$ is an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix. $A$ is called the matrix of the quadratic form.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Orthogonal Change of Variables)
> Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix, then there is an orthogonal change of variables $x = Py$ that transforms the quadratic form $x^{T}Ax$ into a quadratic form $y^{T}Dy$ with no cross product terms.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Types of Quadratic Forms)
> A quadratic form $Q$ is positive definite if $Q(x)>0$ for all $x \neq 0$, negative definite if $Q(x) < 0$ for all $x \neq 0$, and indefinite if $Q(x)$ takes both positive and negative values.

> [!theorem] **Theorem**
> Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix, then the quadratic $Q(x) = x^{T}Ax$ is:
> - Positive definite if and only if the eigenvalues of $A$ are all positive
> - Negative definite if and only if the eigenvalues of $A$ are all negative
> - Indefinite if and only if $A$ has both positive and negative eigenvalues
