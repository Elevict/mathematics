# 4.3 Linearly Independent Sets, Bases

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linear Independence)
> Let $[v_{1}, \ \ v_{2}, \ \ \dots, \ \ v_{p}]$ be $p$ vectors in a vector space $V$, $[v_{1} \ \, v_{2}, \ \, \ \ \dots, \ \ v_{p}]$ is said to be linearly independent if the vector equation $c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\dots+c_{p}v_{p} = 0$ has only the trivial solution $c_{1}=c_{2}=\dots=c_{p}=0$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linear Dependence)
> $[v_{1}, \ \ v_{2}, \ \ \dots, \ \ v_{p}]$ is said to be linearly dependent if the vector equation $c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\dots+c_{p}v_{p} = 0$ has a nontrivial solution, then $c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\dots+c_{p}v_{p} = 0$ is called a linear dependence relation among $\{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p} \}$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Linear Independent Set)
> ${} \{ v_{1}, \ \ v_{2}, \ \ \dots, \ \ v_{p} \} {}$, with $v_{1} \neq 0$ is a linearly independent set if and only if some $v_{j}$ for $j > 1$ is a linear combination of the preceding vectors $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{j-1}$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Basis)
> Let $H$ be a subspace of a vector space $V$, and $b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{p}$ in $V$,
>
> $$
> B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{p} \} \text{ is a basis for } H \text{ if:}
> $$
>
> 1. $B$ is a linearly independent set
> 2. $H = span\{ b_{1}, \ b_{2}, \ \dots, \ b_{p} \}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Identifying Basis of Matrices)
> $A$ is an $n \times n$ invertible matrix if and only if the columns of $A$ are independent and they span $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. So, if $A$ invertible its column form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Spanning Set Theorem)
> Let $S = \{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p} \}$ be a set in $V$ and let $H = span\{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p} \}$
> 1. If one of the vectors in $S$ is a linear combination of the remaining vectors, then the set formed by removing this vector from $S$ still spans $H$.
> 2. There is a subset of $S$ that is a basis for $H$ (If $H \neq \{ 0 \}$)

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Pivot Columns Form Basis)
> The pivot columns of a matrix $A$ form a basis of $COL \ \ A$
