# 4.6 Rank

> [!definition] **Definition** (Row Space)
> If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, the set of all linear combinations of the row vectors of $A$ is called the *row space* of $A$ and is denoted by $Row \ A$. (Notice that $Row \ A = COL \ A^{T}$). The $Row \ A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Row Equivalence)
> If two matrices $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent, then their row spaces are the same. If $B$ is in echelon form, the nonzero rows of $B$ form a basis for ${} Row \ A {}$ as well as for $Row \ B$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Rank of a Matrix)
> The *Rank* of $A$ ($Rank \ A$) is the dimension of $COL \ A$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (The Rank Theorem)
> If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $\text{dim}(COL \ A) = \text{dim}(Row \ A)$
> This common dimension which is $Rank \ A$ satisfies:
>
> $$
> Rank \ A + \text{dim}(Nul \ A) = n
> $$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Invertible Matrix Theorem)
> If $A$ is an $n \times n$ invertible matrix, the following statements are equivalent:
> 1. The columns of $A$ form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
> 2. $\text{dim}(COL \ A) = Rank \ A = n$
> 3. $Nul \ A = \{ 0 \}$
> 4. $\text{dim}(Nul \ A) = 0$
