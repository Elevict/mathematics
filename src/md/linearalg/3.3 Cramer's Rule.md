# 3.3 Cramer's Rule

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Cramer's Rule)
> If $A$ is an $n \times n$ invertible matrix and $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then the unique solution $x\begin{pmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ \vdots \\ x_{n}\end{pmatrix}$ of $Ax = b$ is given by $x_{1} = \frac{\det A_{i}(b)}{\det A}, \ i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ where $A_{i}(b)$ is the matrix obtained from $A$ by replacing column $i$ by $b$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (An Inverse Formula)
> Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ invertible matrix, then
>
> $$
> A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \ Adj \ A
> $$
>
> where $Adj \ A$ (Adjugate of A) is the transpose of the matrix of cofactors.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Area of a Parallelogram)
> If $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix, the area of the parallelogram determined by the columns of $A$ is $|\det A |$
