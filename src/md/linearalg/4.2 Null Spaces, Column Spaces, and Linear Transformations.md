# 4.2 Null Spaces, Column Spaces, and Linear Transformations

> [!definition] **Definition** (Null Space)
> The null space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, $\text{}$ $NUL \ \ A$ is the set of all solutions of the homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$
>
> $$
> NUL \ \ A = \{ x : x \text{ is in } \mathbb{R}^{n} \text{ and } Ax = 0 \}
> $$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Null Space is a Subspace)
> The null space an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (That is the set of all solutions of $Ax = 0$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$)

> [!definition] **Definition** (Column Space)
> The column space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, $COL \ \ A$ is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. That is, if $A = [a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}]$, then
>
> $$
> COL \ \ A = span \{ a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n} \}
> $$
>
> $COL \ \ A$ is the range of the linear transformation $x \to Ax$
>
> $$
> COL \ \ A = \{ b: b = Ax \text{ for some } x \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{m} \}
> $$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Column Space is a Subspace)
> The column space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linear Transformation)
> A linear transformation $T$ from a vector space $V$ into a vector space $W$ is a rule that assigns to each vector $x$ in $V$ a vector $T(x)$ in $W$ such that:
>
> $$
> \begin{align}
> T(u+v) &= T(u)+T(v) \text{ for all } u+v \text{ in } V \\
> T(cu) &= cT(u) \text{ for all } u \text{ in } V \text{ and all scalars } c
> \end{align}
> $$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Kernal)
> The *Kernel* (or null) space of a linear transformation $T$ is the set of all $u$ in $V$ such that $T(u) = 0$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Range)
> The range of $T$ is the set of all vectors in $W$ of the form $T(x)$ for some $x$ in $V$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Subspaces of the Kernel and Range)
> The kernel of $T$ is a subspace of $V$, whereas the range of $T$ is a subspace of $W$.
