# 2.3 Characterization of Invertible Matrices

If $A$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix, the following statements are equivalent:
1. $A$ is invertible
2. $A$ is row equivalent to $I_{n}$
3. $A$ has $n$ pivots
4. $Ax=0$ has only the trivial solution
5. The columns pf $A$ are independent
6. $Ax=b$ has one solution for each $b$
7. $A^{T}$ is invertible

> [!definition] **Definition** (Invertible Linear Transformation)
> A linear transformation $T$ from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is invertible if there exists a function $S$ from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $T(S(x)) = x$ and $S(T(x))=x$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
>
> If $S$ exists, $S$ is called the inverse of $T$ and we write $S = T^{-1}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Uniqueness of Standard Matrix)
> If $T$ from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a linear transformation, then there exists a unique matrix $A$ such that $T(x) = Ax$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. $A$ is the matrix defined by: $A[T(e_{1}) \ \ T(e_{2}) \ \ \dots \ \ T(e_{n})]$ where $e_{j}$ is the jth column of $I_{n}$. $A$ is called the standard matrix of $T$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Inverse Linear Transform)
> If $T$ from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a linear transformation and $A$ its standard matrix, then $T$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is invertible and we have: $T^{-1}(x) = A^{-1}x$.
