## Formula for the Inverse of a $2 \times 2$ Matrix

Let $A = \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\end{bmatrix}$, if $ad - bc \neq 0$, then A is invertible and

$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{bmatrix}
d & -b \\
-c & a
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If $ad - bc = 0$, then $A$ is not invertible.

- The quantity $ad-bc$ is called the **determinant** of $A$, and we write

$$
\det(A) = ad - bc
$$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Uniqueness of Matrix Multiplication)
> If $A$ is an invertible $n \times m$ matrix, then for each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the equation $Ax = b$ has the unique solution $x = A^{-1}b$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Properties of Inverse Matrices)
> 1. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then $A^{-1}$ is invertible and $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$.
> 2. If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ invertible matrices, then so is $AB$, and the inverse of $AB$ is $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$.
> 3. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then so is $A^{T}$ and the inverse of $A^{T}$ is the transpose of $A^{-1}$. That is, $(A^{T})^{-1} = (A^{-1})^{T}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Row Operations into Inverse Matrix)
> An $n \times m$ matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is row equivalent to $I_{n}$, and in this case, any sequence of elementary row operations that reduces $A$ to $I_{n}$ also transforms $I_{n}$ into $A^{-1}$.

## Algorithm for Finding $A^{-1}$

Row reduce the augments matrix $[A \ \ I]$. If $A$ is row equivalent to $I$, then $[A \ \ I]$ is row equivalent to $[I \ \ A^{-1}]$. Otherwise, $A$ does not have an inverse.
