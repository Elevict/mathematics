# 2.1 Matrix Operations

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Sums and Scalar Multiples)

> 1. $A+B=B+A$
> 2. $(A+B)+C=A+(B+A)$

## Row Column Rule for Computing Ab

If the product $AB$ is defined, then the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ of $AB$ is the sum of the products of corresponding entries from row $i$ of $A$ and column $j$ of $B$. If $(AB)_{ij}$ denotes the $(i,j)$ entry in $AB$. And if $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix then

$$
(AB)_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} + \dots + a_{in}b_{nj}
$$

## Properties of Matrix Multiplication

Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix, and let $B$ and $C$ have sizes for which the indicated sums and products are defined. Recall that $I_{m}$ represents the $m \times m$ identity matrix and $I_{m}x = x$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$.

1. ${} A(BC) = (AB)C {}$
2. $A(B+C) = AB + AC$
3. $(B+C)A = BA + CA$
4. $r(AB) = (rA)B = A(rB)$
5. $I_{n}A = A = AI_{n}$

## Warnings:

1. In general, $AB \neq BA$.
2. The cancellation laws do not hold for matrix multiplication. That is, if $AB = AC$, then it is *not* true in general that $B = C$.
3. If a product $AB$ is the zero matrix, you cannot conclude in general that either $A=0$ or $B = 0$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (The Transpose of a Matrix)
> Given an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, the transpose of $A$ is the $n \times m$ matrix, denoted by $A^{T}$, whose columns are formed from the corresponding rows of $A$.

## Properties of Transposes

Let $A$ and $B$ denote matrices whose sizes are appropriate for the following sums and products.
1. $(A^{T})^{T} = A$
2. $(A+B)^{T} = A^{T} + B^{T}$
3. For any scalar $r$, $(rA)^{T} = rA^{T}$
4. $(AB)^{T} = B^{T}A^{T}$
