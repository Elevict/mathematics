# 5.1 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

> [!definition] **Definition** (Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues)
> $\lambda$ is an *eigenvalue* of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ if the equation $Ax = \lambda x$ has a nontrivial solution. Such an $x$ is called an *Eigenvector* corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Triangular Matrix Eigenvalues)
> The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the entries on its main diagonal.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Independence of Eigenvectors)
> If $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \dots, \lambda_{p}$ of an $n \times n$ matrix, then $v_{1}, v_{2}, \dots, v_{p}$ are independent.
