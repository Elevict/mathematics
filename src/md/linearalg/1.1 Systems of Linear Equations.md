# 1.1 Systems of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations is *consistent* if it has either one or infinitely many solutions. A system is *inconsistent* if it has no solutions.

## Elementary Row Operations

1. Interchange two rows
2. Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant (scaling)
3. Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row

> [!example] **Example** (Elementary Row Operations)
> Consider the matrix as the augment matrix of a linear system

> $$
> \begin{pmatrix}
> 1 & -6 & 4 & 0 & -1 \\
> 0 & 2 & -6 & 0 & 4 \\
> 0 & 0 & 1 & 3 & -4 \\
> 0 & 0 & 4 & 7 & 4
> \end{pmatrix}

> [!example] **Example** (Elementary Row Operations 2)
> The augmented matrix of a linear system has been reduced by row operations to the form shown. Continue the appropriate row operations and describe the solution set of the original system.
