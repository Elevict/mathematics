# 5.3 Diagonalization

> [!definition] **Definition** (Diagonalizable Matrix)
> A square matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if $A$ is similar to a diagonal matrix.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Diagonalization Theorem)
> $A$ is diagonalization if and only if $A$ has $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors. In other words, if $A = PDP^{-1}$ with $D$ a diagonal matrix if and only if the columns of $P$ are $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors of $A$. In this case, the diagonal entries of $D$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Distinct Eigenvalues Implies Diagonalizable)
> An $n \times n$ matrix with $n$ distinct eigenvalues is diagonalizable.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Properties of Diagonalizable Matrices)
> Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix whose distinct eigenvalues are $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \dots, \lambda_{p}$
> 1. For $1 \leq k \leq p$, the dimension of the eigenspace for $\lambda_{k}$ is less or equal to the multiplicity of $\lambda_{k}$
> 2. The matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces equals $n$, and this happens if and only if:
> 	1. The characteristic polynomial factors completely into linear factors and
> 	2. The dimension of the eigenspace for each $\lambda_{k}$ equals the multiplicity of $\lambda_{k}$
> 3. If $A$ is diagonalizable and $B_{k}$ is a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda_{k}$ for each $k$, then all vectors in the sets $B_{k}$, for $1 \leq k \leq p$ form an eigenvectors basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

*Remark*

You can imagine it as going from the eigenbasis onto the standard basis, then scaling the basis vectors via the diagonal matrix, then returning back into the eigenbasis.
