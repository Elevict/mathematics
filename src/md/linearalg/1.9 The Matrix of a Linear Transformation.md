# 1.9 The Matrix of a Linear Transformation

## The Matrix of a Linear Transformation

Whenever a linear transformation $T$ arises geometrically or is described in words, we usually want a “formula” for $T(\mathbf{x})$. The discussion that follows shows that every linear transformation from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ is actually a matrix transformation $\mathbf{x} \mapsto A\mathbf{x}$, and that important properties of $T$ are intimately related to familiar properties of $A$. The key to finding $A$ is to observe that $T$ is completely determined by what it does to the columns of the $n \times n$ identity matrix $I_n$.

**Example 1**
The columns of $I_2$ are:

$$
I_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Let $e_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $e_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Suppose $T$ is a linear transformation from $\mathbb{R}^2$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that:

$$
T(e_1) = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad T(e_2) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

We want to find a formula for the image of an arbitrary vector $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

## Solution

Write:

$$
\mathbf{x} = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = x_1 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + x_2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2
$$

Since $T$ is linear, we have:

$$
T(\mathbf{x}) = x_1 T(e_1) + x_2 T(e_2) = x_1 \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} + x_2 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Thus,

$$
T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{pmatrix} 5x_1 + 3x_2 \\ 7x_1 + 8x_2 \\ 2x_1 + 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

The step from equation (1) to equation (2) explains why knowledge of $T(e_1)$ and $T(e_2)$ is sufficient to determine $T(\mathbf{x})$ for any $\mathbf{x}$. Moreover, since this expresses $T(\mathbf{x})$ as a linear combination of vectors, we can put these vectors into the columns of a matrix $A$ and write:

$$
T(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{pmatrix} T(e_1) & T(e_2) \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = A\mathbf{x}
$$

> $$
> A = \begin{pmatrix} T(e_1) & \cdots & T(e_n) \end{pmatrix}
> $$

## Example 2

Find the standard matrix $A$ for the dilation transformation $T(\mathbf{x}) = 3\mathbf{x}$, for $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

### Solution

Write:

$$
T(e_1) = 3e_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad T(e_2) = 3e_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Thus:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Example 3

Let $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be the transformation that rotates each point in $\mathbb{R}^2$ about the origin through an angle $\varphi$, with counterclockwise rotation for a positive angle. Find the standard matrix $A$ of this transformation.

### Solution

The vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ rotates into $\begin{pmatrix} \cos \varphi \\ \sin \varphi \end{pmatrix}$, and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ rotates into $\begin{pmatrix} -\sin \varphi \\ \cos \varphi \end{pmatrix}$.

Then, we have:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \varphi & -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi & \cos \varphi \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Geometric Linear Transformations of $\mathbb{R}^2$

Examples 2 and 3 illustrate linear transformations that are described geometrically. Tables 1–4 illustrate other common geometric linear transformations of the plane. Because the transformations are linear, they are determined completely by what they do to the columns of $I_2$. Instead of showing only the images of $e_1$ and $e_2$, the tables show what a transformation does to the unit square.

Other transformations can be constructed from those listed in Tables 1–4 by applying one transformation after another. For instance, a horizontal shear could be followed by a reflection in the $x_2$-axis. Section 2.1 will show that such a composition of linear transformations is linear.

## Existence and Uniqueness Questions

The concept of a linear transformation provides a new way to understand the existence and uniqueness questions asked earlier.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Surjective Linear Mapping)
> A mapping $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be **onto** $\mathbb{R}^m$ if each $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is the image of at least one $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Equivalently, $T$ is onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ when the range of $T$ is all of the codomain $\mathbb{R}^m$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Injective Linear Mapping)
> A mapping $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be **one-to-one** if each $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is the image of at most one $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Example 4

Let $T$ be the linear transformation whose standard matrix is:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 & 8 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Does $T$ map $\mathbb{R}^4$ onto $\mathbb{R}^3$? Is $T$ a one-to-one mapping?

### Solution

Since $A$ is in echelon form, we can see that $A$ has a pivot position in each row. Note that $T$ maps $\mathbb{R}^4$ onto $\mathbb{R}^3$. However, since the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a free variable (because there are four variables and only three pivot variables), $T$ is not one-to-one.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Determining Injective Mapping of Linear Transform)
> Let $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation. Then $T$ is one-to-one if and only if the equation $T(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ has only the trivial solution.
