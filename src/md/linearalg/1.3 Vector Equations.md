# 1.3 Vector Equations

> [!definition] **Definition** (Set of Vectors)
> $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the set of all $n$-tuples of the form $u = \begin{bmatrix}u_{1} \\ u_{2} \\ \vdots \\ u_{n} \end{bmatrix}$

## Algebraic Properties of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

If $u, v, w$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $c, d$ scalars

$$
\begin{align}
u+v &= v+u \\
(u+v)+w &= u+(v+w) \\
u+0 &= u \\
u+(-u) &= 0 \\
c(u+v) &= cu+cv \\
(c+d)u &= cu + du \\
c(du) &= (cd)u \\
1u &= u
\end{align}
$$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Linear Combination)
> Given $u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p}$ with $p$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{p}$ with $p$ scalars in $\mathbb{R}$ $u = c_{1}u_{1} + c_{2}u_{2}+\dots+c_{p}u_{p}$ is called a **linear combination** of $u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p}$ (with weights $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{p}$)

> [!definition] **Definition** (Span)
> If $u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p}$ are $p$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then the **span** of $u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p}$ is the subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that consists of all linear combinations of $u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p}$. We denote this subset by $span(u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p})$. If $u$ is in $span(u_{1}, u_{2}, \dots, u_{p})$, then $u$ can be written in the form $u = c_{1}u_{2}+c_{2}u_{2}+\dots+c_{p}u_{p}$
