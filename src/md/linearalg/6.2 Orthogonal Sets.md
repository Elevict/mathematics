# 6.2 Orthogonal Sets

> [!definition] **Definition** (Orthogonal Set)
> A set of vector $\{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is an orthogonal set if each pair of distinct vectors from the set is orthogonal, that is $u_{i} \cdot u_{j} = 0$ whenever $i \neq j$.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Basis Formed from Orthogonal Set)
> If $S = \{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ is an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $S$ is linearly independent and hence is a basis of the subspace spanned by the vectors in $S$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Orthogonal Basis)
> An orthogonal basis for a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a basis that is also orthogonal

> [!theorem] **Theorem**
> If $\{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ is an orthogonal basis for a subspace $W$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then for all $x$ in $W$,

> x = c_{1}u_{1} + c_{2}u_{2} + \dots + c_{p}u_{p} \quad \text{ with } \quad c_{i} = \frac{x \cdot  u_{i}}{u_{i}\cdot u_{j}} \text{ for } i = 1, \dots, p

## Orthogonal Projection

Given $y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $u$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $y = \hat{y} + z$ where $\hat{y}$ is a multiple of $u$ and $z$ is orthogonal to $u$
$\hat{y} = \alpha u$ with $\alpha = \frac{y \cdot u}{u \cdot u}$ and $z = y - \hat{y}$, whereby $\hat{y}$ is called the orthogonal projection of $y$ onto $u$, and we write:

$\hat{y} = proj_{u}(y) = proj_{L}(y)$ where $L$ is the subspace spanned by $u$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Orthonormal Sets)
> $\{ u_{1}, \dots, u_{p} \}$ is an orthonormal set if it is an orthogonal set of unit vectors.

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Inverse of Orthonormal Columns)
> An $m \times n$ matrix $U$ has orthonormal columns if and only if $U^{T} \cdot U = I_{n}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Properties of Orthonormal Columns)
> Let $U$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with orthonormal columns and $x, y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ then,
