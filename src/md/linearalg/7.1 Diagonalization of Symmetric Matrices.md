# 7.1 Diagonalization of Symmetric Matrices

> [!definition] **Definition** (Symmetric Matrix)
> An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is symmetric if $A^{T} = A$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Orthogonality of Eigenspaces)
> If $A$ is symmetric, then eigenvectors from different eigenspaces are orthogonal.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Orthogonal Matrix is Invertible)
> An orthogonal matrix is a square invertible matrix such that $A^{-1} = A^{T}$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Orthogonally Diagonalizable)
> An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be orthogonally diagonalizable if there are an orthogonal matrix $P$ and a diagonal matrix $D$ such that $A = PDP^{-1} = PDP^{T}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Symmetric Matrix)
> An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable if and only if, $A$ is symmetric

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (The Spectral Theorem for Symmetric Matrices)
> If $A$ is an $n \times n$ symmetric matrix, then
> - $A$ has $n$ real eigenvalues counting multiplicity
> - The dimension the eigenspace for each eigenvalue $\lambda$ equals the multiplicity of $\lambda$
> - Eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenspaces are orthogonal
> - $A$ is orthogonally diagonalizable
