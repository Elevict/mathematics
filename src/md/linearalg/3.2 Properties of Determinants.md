# 3.2 Properties of Determinants

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Determinant Properties)
> Let $A$ be a square matrix
>
> - If matrix $B$ is obtained from matrix $A$ by adding a multiple of a row of $A$ to another row of $A$, then $\det A = \det B$
> - If matrix $B$ is obtained from matrix $A$ by interchanging 2 rows of $A$ then, $\det B = - \det A$
> - If matrix $B$ is obtained from multiplying one row of $A$ by a scalar $k$ then, $\det B = k \det A$
> - If a matrix $A$ is reduced to an echelon form $U$ by row replacements and $r$ row interchanges then $\det A = (-1)^{r} \det U$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Invertibility Depends on Determinant)
> A square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is different from zero.
