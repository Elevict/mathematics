# 6.4 The Gram-Schmidt Process

## The Gram-Schmidt Process

The **Gram-Schmidt process** is an algorithm that takes a set of linearly independent vectors $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ and turns them into an orthonormal set $\{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\}$. The process is useful for orthogonalizing vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ or other inner product spaces, leading to orthonormal bases that are easier to work with in various applications.

### Step-by-step Procedure:

Given a set of linearly independent vectors $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$:

1. **Start with the first vector**:

$$
   u_1 = \frac{v_1}{\|v_1\|}
$$

   This normalizes $v_1$ to create $u_1$.

2. **For each subsequent vector $v_k$, subtract the projection onto the previous orthonormal vectors**:
   - Compute the projection of $v_k$ onto $u_1, u_2, \dots, u_{k-1}$:

$$
     \text{proj}_{u_i} v_k = \frac{v_k \cdot u_i}{u_i \cdot u_i} u_i
$$

   - Subtract the projections from $v_k$ to obtain a vector orthogonal to all previous vectors:

$$
     \tilde{v}_k = v_k - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \text{proj}_{u_i} v_k
$$

  - Normalize $\tilde{v}_k$ to get $u_k$:

$$
     u_k = \frac{\tilde{v}_k}{\|\tilde{v}_k\|}
$$

3. **Repeat** this process until you have an orthonormal set $\{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\}$.

### Example:

Given vectors $\{v_1, v_2\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$:
- Step 1: Normalize $v_1$:

  $$
  u_1 = \frac{v_1}{\|v_1\|}


$$
- Step 2: Subtract the projection of $v_2$ onto $u_1$ and normalize the result:
$$

u_2 = \frac{v_2 - \text{proj}_{u_1} v_2}{\|v_2 - \text{proj}_{u_1} v_2\|}

$$
### QR Factorization

The **QR factorization** is a decomposition of a matrix $A$ into a product of two matrices: $Q$ (an orthogonal matrix) and $R$ (an upper triangular matrix). This decomposition is especially useful in solving linear systems and for eigenvalue algorithms.

Given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, the goal is to decompose it as:
$$

A = QR

$$
where:

- $Q$ is an $m \times m$ orthogonal matrix, meaning $Q^T Q = I$.
- $R$ is an $m \times n$ upper triangular matrix.

#### Steps for QR Factorization:

1. **Apply the Gram-Schmidt process** to the columns of matrix $A$ to generate an orthonormal set of vectors (which form the columns of $Q$).

2. **Construct the matrix $R$** by projecting the columns of $A$ onto the orthonormal vectors of $Q$. The elements of $R$ are computed as:
   
$$

   r_{ij} = q_i \cdot a_j

   $$
   where $q_i$ is the $i$th column of $Q$ and $a_j$ is the $j$th column of $A$.

3. **Combine $Q$ and $R$** to obtain the factorization.

#### Example:
Given a matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$:
1. Perform the Gram-Schmidt process on the columns of $A$ to obtain $Q$.
2. Compute $R$ using the projections of the original columns onto the orthonormal vectors in $Q$.
