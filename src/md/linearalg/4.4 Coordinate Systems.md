# 4.4 Coordinate Systems

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (The Unique Representation Theorem)
> Let $B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n} \}$ be a *basis* for a vector space $V$, then for each $x$ in $V$ there exists a unique set of scalars $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{n}$ such that $x = c_{1}b_{1} + c_{2}b_{3} + \dots + c_{n}b_{n}$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Coordinate Mapping)
> If $B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n} \}$ is a *basis* for a vector space $V$ and $x$ in $V$, then coordinates of $x$ relative to the basis $B$ (Or $B$ coordinates) are the scalars $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{n}$ such that $x = c_{1}b_{1} + c_{2}b_{2} + \dots + c_{n}b_{n}$

> If $c_{1}, c_{2}, \dots, c_{n}$ are the $B$ coordinates of $x$, then the vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

> [!definition] **Definition** (Change of Basis Matrix)
> Let $B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n} \}$ be a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and let $P_{B} = [b_{1}, \dots, b_{n}]$.

> $P_{n}$ is called the change of coordinates matrix from $B$ to the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and we have:

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Coordinate Mapping is a Linear Transform)
> Let $B = \{ b_{1}, b_{2}, \dots, b_{n} \}$ be a basis for a vector space $V$, then the coordinate mapping $x \to [x]_{B}$ is a one to one linear transformation from $V$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

> [!definition] **Definition** (Isomorphisms)
> A one to one linear transformation from a vector space $V$ onto a vector space $W$ is called an isomorphism.

> Example: The coordinate mapping is an isomorphism from $V$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
