# 1.6 Applications of Linear Systems

## A Homogeneous System in Economics

Suppose a nation's economy is divided into many sectors (e.g., manufacturing, communication, entertainment, and service industries). Assume we know each sector's total output for one year and exactly how this output is exchanged among other sectors. Let the total dollar value of a sector's output be referred to as the price of that output. Leontief proved the following result:

> There exist equilibrium prices that can be assigned to the total outputs of the various sectors in such a way that the income of each sector exactly balances its expenses.

### Example: Finding Equilibrium Prices

Consider an economy with three sectors: **Coal**, **Electric (power)**, and **Steel**. The output of each sector is distributed among the various sectors as shown in Table 1, where the entries in a column represent the fractional parts of a sector's total output.

The second column of Table 1 indicates that the Electric sector's output is divided as follows:
- 40% to Coal,
- 50% to Steel, and
- 10% to Electric.

Since all output must be accounted for, the decimal fractions in each column must sum to 1.

Let:
- $p_C$ be the price of Coal's total output,
- $p_E$ be the price of Electric's total output, and
- $p_S$ be the price of Steel's total output.

**Goal**: Find equilibrium prices that make each sector's income equal its expenditures.

#### Table 1: a Simple Economy


| Distribution of Output From | Coal | Electric | Steel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Coal** | 0.0 | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| **Electric** | 0.6 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
| **Steel** | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.2 |

### Solution: Income/Expense Requirements

1. **Coal Sector* 
   The first row of Table 1 shows that Coal receives:
   - 40% of Electric's output: $0.4p_E$,
   - 60% of Steel's output: $0.6p_S$.


   Therefore, Coal's total expenses are $0.4p_E + 0.6p_S$, and its income/expense equation is:
$$p_C = 0.4p_E + 0.6p_S$$

2. **Electric Sector**  
   The second row of Table 1 shows that Electric spends:
   - 60% of Coal's output: $0.6p_C$,
   - 10% of its own output: $0.1p_E$,
   - 20% of Steel's output: $0.2p_S$.

   The income/expense equation for Electric is:

   $$p_E = 0.6p_C + 0.1p_E + 0.2p_S$$

3. **Steel Sector**  
   The third row shows that Steel spends:
   - 40% of Coal's output: $0.4p_C$,
   - 50% of Electric's output: $0.5p_E$,
   - 20% of its own output: $0.2p_S$.

   The income/expense equation for Steel is:

   $$p_S = 0.4p_C + 0.5p_E + 0.2p_S$$

### System of Equations
To solve, move all unknowns to the left and combine like terms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  p_C - 0.4p_E - 0.6p_S &= 0 \\
  -0.6p_C + 0.9p_E - 0.2p_S &= 0 \\
  -0.4p_C - 0.5p_E + 0.8p_S &= 0

\end{aligned}
$$

### Row Reduction
After row reduction, the general solution is:

$$

p_C = 0.94p_S, \quad p_E = 0.85p_S, \quad p_S \text{ is free}.
$$

The equilibrium price vector for the economy has the form:

$$

p = p_S \begin{bmatrix} 0.94 \\ 0.85 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Choosing $p_S = 100$, we find that:
- $p_C = 94$,
- $p_E = 85$,
- $p_S = 100$.

Thus, the equilibrium prices for Coal, Electric, and Steel are \$94 million, \$85 million, and \$100 million, respectively.

## Balancing Chemical Equations

Chemical equations represent the quantities of substances consumed and produced by chemical reactions. For example, the combustion of propane (C₃H₈) in oxygen (O₂) forms carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O). The equation for the reaction is:


$$

x_1 \text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + x_2 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow x_3 \text{CO}_2 + x_4 \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

### Atom Balancing
To balance the equation, the numbers of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms on both sides of the equation must match. Represent each reactant and product as vectors listing the number of atoms per molecule:

$\text{C}_3\text{H}_8: \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
$\text{O}_2: \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
$\text{CO}_2: \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
$\text{H}_2\text{O}: \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

The balancing equation becomes:

$$

x_1 \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + x_2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} = x_3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + x_4 \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Solving the System
Solving this system using row reduction yields:

$$

x_1 = \frac{1}{4}x_4, \quad x_2 = \frac{5}{4}x_4, \quad x_3 = \frac{3}{4}x_4
$$

To balance the equation, let $x_4 = 4$, resulting in:

$$

x_1 = 1, \quad x_2 = 5, \quad x_3 = 3.
$$

Thus, the balanced equation is:

$$
\text{C}_3\text{H}_8 + 5\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{CO}_2 + 4\text{H}_2\text
{O}
$$

Chemists typically prefer balanced equations with the smallest possible whole numbers for coefficients.
