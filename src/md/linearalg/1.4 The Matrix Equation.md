# 1.4 The Matrix Equation

## Definition

> [!definition] **Definition** (Product of a Matrix with a Vector)
> If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with columns $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$ and if $x$ $\begin{bmatrix}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ \vdots \\ x_{n} \end{bmatrix}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then the product $Ax$ is the linear combination $x_{1}a_{1} + x_{2}a_{2} + \dots + x_{n}a_{n}$

> [!theorem] **Theorem** (Solution of Matrix Equation)
> The equation $Ax = b$ has a solution if and only if $b$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$

If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, the following statements are equivalent
- For each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$, the equation $Ax=b$ has a solution
- Each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$
- The columns of $A$ span $R^{m}$
- $A$ has a pivot position in every row

## Properties of the Product $Ax$

If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $u$, $v$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $c$ a scalar

$$
\begin{align}
A(u+v) &= Au + Av \\
A(cu) &= c(Au)
\end{align}
